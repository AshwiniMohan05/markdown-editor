## Markdown Theming app

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[9] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
